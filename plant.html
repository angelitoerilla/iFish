										<p>Plants in the foreground need to be low-growing so they don't block the view of rest of your aquarium. They can be individual plants or ground cover type plants. Rosettes such as the Dwarf Lilly, Dwarf Anubias, Micro-Sword Grass, and some of the Cryptocoryne's work real well. Stem plants like the Fountain Plant and the Japanese Rush are great individual plants for the foreground and can also be used as additional focal points.</p>

										<p>The mid-ground area of your aquarium is the primary focal area. Careful placement of plants in this area is important for a balanced design. It is also important to include open swimming space for your fish in this area. Consider low-growing and moderate height plants. Those that bush out can be perfect, as they will have plenty of room to grow and can become the main attraction. Stem plants work great for this area, as many of them are moderate in height as well as have some bushyness to them. There are also fern plants and rosette plants that can work well.</p>

You need to be careful that the plants you choose for height don't also bush out too much. unless you want plants that will fill in both the background area as well as the middle area.</p>

									<h1 class="card-title">Pros of Artificial Plants
									</h1>
									<hr>

														
									<p class="description">If you find that some of the drawbacks of live plants are a little too much for you, there is nothing wrong with choosing artificial decor for your aquarium. Fake plants are most often made of plastic, and some can look almost real. If you put your mind to it, an aquascaped tank with artificial decorations can look just as good as a tank with real plants.<br>

									Plastic plants are easy to remove and clean when they get mucked up, and replacing them is simple. You can also rearrange your tank any time you wish. In fact, rearranging decor in a tank is one way some fish keepers keep semi-aggressive species in check. Territorial behaviors can be minimized when the territory is changing all the time. Some fish that live in brackish water require artificial decorations, as freshwater plants will quickly perish in their tanks. You may also find the durability of artificial decorations preferable in African cichlid tanks, as these fish have a tendency to move a lot of gravel around, and can easily unearth plants live or artificial.<br>

									Vacuuming your tank is a breeze with fake plants. You don’t need to worry about the root system, and you can even take the decorations out as you clean the tank. And, you won’t have to worry about vegetable matter accumulating on the substrate.</p>

									<h1 class="card-title">Cons of Artificial Plants
									</h1>
									<hr>

													
									<p class="description">Life with artificial aquarium plants is free and easy. But as you probably realize by now there are some drawbacks as well. The first has to do with appearance. Many plastic plants look terrible, and some even come in colors that don’t really exist in nature. The bottoms are lightweight plastic, designed to grab into the gravel, but this rarely works. Instead, they often float to the top, causing a whole lot of aggravation.<br>

									There are also some really good artificial plants out there. They have weighted bottoms so they stay where you put them, and at first glance they look very real. These are the decorations you want if you intend to go artificial. However, they are somewhat expensive, and adding three or four large ones may end up costing as much as the tank itself.<br>

									Of course, the biggest drawback is that fake plants do not have the same natural properties as their live counterparts. This means you need to be more on the ball with water changes, algae removal and general tank maintenance. You may wish to over-filter your tank, and you will probably want to add some filter media such as activated carbon to help deal with waste chemicals.<br>

									Can fish tell the difference between live and artificial plants? Fake decorations serve the same purpose as live, providing shelter and a realistic environment. However, it seems reasonable to assume that fish that live in aquariums with artificial decor are missing out on something. For some it may be a dietary supplement. For others, there may simply be a sense of well-being that comes with natural items.</p>
